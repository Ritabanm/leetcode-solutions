            abhi[a-left] = abhi[a+right] = left + right +1 # and in the final step we have to merge the left group and right group if it makes the contigeous substring of 1's , basically we are increasing the length of group because finally we want to deal with the length of groups . this step is kind of similiar to the step which we do in sub array sum equal to k problem .
